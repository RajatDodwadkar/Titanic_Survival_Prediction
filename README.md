# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning and exploratory data analysis.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the classic Titanic dataset and builds predictive models to determine whether a passenger survived the disaster.

### Key Steps:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and insights
- **Data preprocessing**: handling null values, encoding, feature engineering
- **Training classification algorithms** to predict survival
- **Model evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA highlights include:
- Survival rates across **gender**, **class**, **embarked port**
- Relationship between **age**, **fare**, and survival
- Correlation matrix and feature impact visualization

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML models and evaluation)
